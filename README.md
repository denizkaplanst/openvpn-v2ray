# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1-Install OpenVPN and v2ray client on your system.
2-Download the OpenVPN configuration file from your VPN provider and save it in a directory (e.g., /etc/openvpn).
3-Create a new file called "v2ray.json" in the same directory (/etc/openvpn) with the following contents:
"
{
  "inbounds": [{
    "port": 1080,
    "protocol": "socks"
  }],
  "outbounds": [{
    "protocol": "vmess",
    "settings": {
      "vnext": [{
        "address": "<v2ray-server-address>",
        "port": <v2ray-server-port>,
        "users": [{
          "id": "<v2ray-user-id>",
          "alterId": <v2ray-alter-id>,
          "security": "auto"
        }]
      }]
    },
    "streamSettings": {
      "network": "tcp",
      "tcpSettings": {
        "header": {
          "type": "http",
          "request": {
            "version": "1.1",
            "method": "GET",
            "path": ["/"],
            "headers": {
              "Host": ["<v2ray-server-domain>"]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }]
}
"
Replace <v2ray-server-address> with your v2ray server address, <v2ray-server-port> with the v2ray server port, <v2ray-user-id> with your v2ray user ID, <v2ray-alter-id> with the v2ray alter ID, and <v2ray-server-domain> with the v2ray server domain.

4-Start the v2ray client using the following command:  
  
"  v2ray -config /etc/openvpn/v2ray.json "
  
5- Start the OpenVPN client using the following command: 
  
  "  openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/<openvpn-configuration-file> --socks-proxy 127.0.0.1 1080   "
  
  Replace <openvpn-configuration-file> with the name of your OpenVPN configuration file.

That's it! You should now be able to use OpenVPN and proxy through v2ray client.
